# wicked.haufe.io SAML SDK

This library helps implementing Authorization Servers for federating SAML identites (SSO identities) into a wicked.haufe.io OAuth2.0 Implicit Grant Flow API implementation.

It does the heavy lifting regarding implementing a SAML SP (Service Provider) which talks to the IdP.

More documentation to come.
